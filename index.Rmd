# About Me 
My name is Sarah Leder and I am an MSW candidate at the University of Michigan's School of Social Work. I am concentrating my studies in Social Policy and Evaluation with an interest in Communities and social systems. My professional experiences are focused on the American criminal justice system and justice reform.

## Current Work
This summer, I am working as a research and policy intern at the Justice Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. I am working on projects concerning the parole process in Maryland, D.C.'s Youth Rehabilitation Act, the price of incarcerating youth across the U.S., and the practice of transferring youth from the juvenile justice system to the adult criminal justice system.

# My Porfolio
As the summer continues, I will add content to this GitHub space that displays the data visualization and analysis skills I am acquiring. Below are samples of my previous work:

* [Spring 2019 Portfolio](https://scleder.github.io/Dataviz2019/Spring_2019_Portfolio.html)
* [Mapping with R](https://scleder.github.io/Dataviz2019/RMaps.html)
* [Transferring Youth to Adult Court](https://scleder.github.io/Dataviz2019/Waived_Youth.html)
* More to come
