# About Me 
My name is Sarah Leder and I am an MSW candidate at the University of Michigan's School of Social Work. I am concentrating my studies in Social Policy and Evaluation with an interest in Communities and social systems. My professional experiences are focused on the American criminal justice system and justice reform.

## Current Work
This summer, I am working as a research and policy intern at the Justice Policy Institute in Washington, D.C. I am working on projects concerning how young adults (ages 18-22) are charged and sentenced in D.C.

# My Porfolio
As the summer continues, I will add content to this GitHub space that displays the data visualization and analysis skills I am acquiring. Below are samples of my previous work:

* [Spring 2019 Portfolio](https://scleder.github.io/Dataviz2019/Spring_2019_Portfolio.html)
* [Mapping with R](https://scleder.github.io/Dataviz2019/RMaps.html)
* [Transferring Youth to Adult Court](https://scleder.github.io/Dataviz2019/Waived_Youth.html)
* More to come
